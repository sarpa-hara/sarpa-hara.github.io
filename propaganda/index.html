<br><br>
<p>I believe that the drug enthusiast community is becoming increasingly better at striking a behavioral balance between normalizing sustainable and responsible drug-fueled hedonism and making the idea of harm reduction salient.</p>
<p>Most of us have been exposed to biased, moralistic anti-drug propaganda. Some of us (rightfully so) aim to deconstruct such propaganda and invalidate it as a reductionist, uninformed viral idea about a specific drug (“GHB is a date-rape drug.&quot;) or a category of substances (“All opioids are morbidly addictive.&quot;)</p>
<p>Reductionist associations between drugs and their effects are sticky and pervasive. Our brains are wired to make speedy associations between entities in the physical world, and the potential danger they entail – as an efficient survival strategy. Anti-drug propagandists actively exploit this. None of the stated is news to anyone.</p>
<p>The point being made is that certain pervasive factoids are etched too deeply. To some of us (my guilty self included), they replace the motivation to look at certain things in a more nuanced way, because the nuanced way demands above-baseline cognitive processing. As a result, the old and familiar drug-averse sentiment bubbles up to the surface and makes its way into an otherwise healthy discussion.</p>
<p>I saw a post on r/Drugs not long ago, where someone asked whether their significant other should try methamphetamine for the first time. Immediately, there was no shortage of red-flag-waving retorts hastily besmirching the good name of methamphetamine. I say this with my tongue in my cheek, referring to the barrage of brief, knee-jerk comments that could be summarized as “Anything but meth! Meth is evil! Addiction from one-time use is imminent!”.</p>
<p>This kind of public attitude is pernicious for several reasons. For starters, it assumes that the person who expressed interest in trying a particular substance is so mentally frail, that a single experience is bound to result in crippling addiction. I’m not sure if I’m picking the right word, but I find this somewhat disrespectful towards the person in question.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it was not a good look for that particular sub-community, to hold easy-thinking attitudes towards certain drugs. Here’s the deal with meth, in particular, boys and girls: I am one of the handful of people in my country of residence, who is legally prescribed methamphetamine, as a last resort adjunct treatment for a severe, long-standing eating disorder. At therapeutic doses, methamphetamine is practically indiscernible from dextroamphetamine. There is no woo-woo feature endemic to the methamphetamine molecule, that makes it cripplingly addictive. For people like myself, this substance has provided true therapeutic value for a fixed time. There is some evidence that methamphetamine is one of several neurotoxic stimulants, but the neurotoxicity is generally a function of large doses and prolonged use. I am harping on this post in particular, with a (possibly) biased voice that may scream “meth fanboy”, because the comment section of that post wasn’t about judgment-free harm reduction. It was an unequivocal cacophony of “METH, NOT EVEN ONCE”. That’s a far cry from harm reduction. That is putting up false scarecrows as a kind of effortless replacement for substance use education.</p>
<p>I acknowledge my own biases, and for full context/disclosure, I am a proponent of legalizing all consumable psychotropic substances. I believe that the arm of the law is reaching into our personal lives with untenable invasiveness. I also believe that the scheduling system is direly arbitrary, as is the general public’s consensus on what are “soft” and “hard” drugs. Thus, it irks me when I see members of an allegedly substance-cognizant online forum rushing to inject their scarecrow-esque beliefs into a situation that they don’t fully understand, involving individuals they do not know, speaking out against substances, the pharmacodynamics of which they poorly comprehend.</p>
<p>Given all of the above, I am not advertising the perks of methamphetamine use, nor do I necessarily believe that the type of behavior I’m talking about is particularly common among us. Given the common interests that tie me to the somewhat generalized mass of drugs enthusiasts, I think it pays to be completely open-minded about all substances, known and yet unknown, and to welcome the idea that we have the right to do dangerous things to ourselves, to weigh risks against rewards, and to allow ourselves partake in a variety of experiences, as long as we make an effort to keep ourselves substantially informed.</p>
