<p>Have you heard about the new kid on the block? If you frequent r/researchchemicals, you might have.</p>
<p>The kid is not so new. In the late 60s and early 70s, pharmaceutical amphetamine abuse in the United States was hiking up a steep hill. The Benzedrine Era was nearing its end, making way for everyone&rsquo;s favorite Controlled Substances Act of 1971. For pharmaceutical manufacturers, it was research o&rsquo;clock. The stimulant market wasn&rsquo;t becoming any less lucrative, even with tighter regulations now in place.</p>
<p>The year is 1963, and the big nerds at McNeil Laboraties are grabbing their drawing boards and running to the United States Patent Office, with exciting things to share. They have discovered a class of <a href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/022962468/publication/US3161650A?q=pn%3DUS3161650">molecule</a>s whose properties were going to meet the &ldquo;demand for new and [amphetamine-]unrelated types of compounds, which will exhibit such [stimulant] activity without possessing a chemical structure which the known compounds possess, and with which their undesirable side effects appear to be connected&rdquo; [1]. These compounds weren&rsquo;t going to be riddled with all of the bad no-no stuff associated with amphetamines, no way!  But, uh oh, what&rsquo;s that? Looks like scientifically uninformed drug marketing talk can make its way even into a US patent. McNeil Laboratories really wanted their new tweaksauce to be a commercial success, and not the deadly, questionable and stupidly infamous Aminorex – the compound in question – it turned out to be. Now, Aminorex is chilling in Schedule I, right there and cozy with the &lsquo;luudes.</p>
<p>In 1971, <em>Laboratoires Dausse</em> (Synthélabo) successfully filed a <a href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/023428296/publication/US3321470A?q=pn%3DUS3321470">US patent</a> for a novel stimulant – 5-Phenyl-2-CYCLopropylamino-4-OxAZOlinONE – in the spirit of the contemporary rise of oxazolinone derivates (such as Pemoline and Aminorex). This &ldquo;me too&rdquo; drug was significantly more potent as a stimulant than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemoline">Pemoline</a>, and demonstrated something resembling a safe therapeutic profile, after killing off a few cute rodents. The FDA and even the U.N. Convention on Psychotropic Substances, however, never gave a lab rat&rsquo;s ass about it. Cyclazodone was never marketed for any ailment, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Luckily, we live in a world where virtually any questionable substance is available online for our purchase and consumption. Nothing quite like some tasteful kidney stones, tachycardia and pulmonary hypertension from something labelled willy-nilly as a &ldquo;nootropic&rdquo; (which makes it safe – <em>science</em>), all in the name of getting <strong>zooted</strong>. Get yourself a gram of the inadequately studied Cyclazodone, and become a researcher TODAY! Just kidding – don&rsquo;t do that. <em>I</em> did it so that you, fellow drug connoisseur, don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Never before have I tried a more potent – yet utterly dysfunctional – drug of the stimulant breed. At 30mg down the oral cavity my pupils and my ego were more inflated than crypto prices in 2021. Looking back at some Cyclazodone-fueled shit-slinging Reddit posts in recent months, it pains me to know what kind of dormant asshole lives in me, brought to the surface by the magic of drugs. I&rsquo;m suddenly bored of writing paragraphs, so there&rsquo;s a bullet list of notable effects from personal experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Empathy suppression, inflated-sense of self-worth, acting like a sheer dick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dry mouth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appetite suppression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some enhanced verbal fluency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A difficult to describe sickly-sweet nauseated feeling, resembling the anticipation of an exciting event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow I&rsquo;ve been at the gym for 2 hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on all the wrong things, I was told this was a Nootropic, who do I sue?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased sex appeal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are these weird stabbing pains in my abdomen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What the hell are &ldquo;elevated liver enzymes&rdquo; and why are they in my blood?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A little serious harm reduction note: be careful with Aminorex analogues. Be <em>very</em> careful when some money-hungry chemical supplier slaps the &ldquo;nootropic&rdquo; label on a compound, the pharmacology of which hasn&rsquo;t been properly studied.</p>
<p>Stay safe, kids. ✌️</p>
