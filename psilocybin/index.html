<p>At the onset, It gently commanded me to lie down, as if my body was not meant to interfere in any way with Its function. With eyes shut, I swept through chrome waterfalls and past floating baroque-like structures that vibrated and pulsated with the rhythm of splashing water nearby. When I forced my eyes open I could see rainbow hexagons spinning and swirling instead of the usual dancing specks you see when you look at clear blue skies. I closed my eyes again and stared at the rose gold ceiling of a tall ornate cathedral with symmetrically positioned long marble strips of floating symbols that resembled Greek letters. It was entertaining me with the mildest of Its incarnations, and I remained calmly curious for some time. I was being effortlessly convinced that the extent of my control was minimal.</p>
<p>While my beam of subjectivity was steered from mirage to mirage, on several occasions what I had seen, birthed a strong sense of trespassing and an irrational fear of ineffable yet very inevitable consequences. As I approached yet another jagged mechanical structure floating in the darkness of the cosmos, I was met with a brass canine-looking creature that disapprovingly shook its head at me, as I became threateningly persuaded that this entity is not for me to explore, that I am forbidden from delving into this particular illusion, that I am not welcome by the entity that was in front of me.</p>
<p>My consciousness made a swift leap to the physical world. I saw my friends (a married couple) in the lake water by the edge of the pier, clinging to each other, resting their heads on each other’s shoulders. I started thinking about how happy they were at that moment, and how genuine their quiet display of affection seemed. I thought about how such love is formed and imagined two individuals in each other’s arms, gradually expelling an impenetrable, nearly transparent shield of energy around them, becoming cocooned by it over time. And I saw a multitude of other couples like the aforementioned, steadily growing and nurturing their resplendent domes. This was the visual definition of true love, an entity developed over time by those who refuse to let go of each other.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Scorching. The light penetrating my closed eyelids slowly transitioned from bright orange to blindingly white, and finally, to saturated searing red. I was approaching the sun itself, pulled upwards by my center of gravity, because that is where It wanted to carry me. I was going to be swallowed by it.
I pulled my eyelids apart, not without some effort, and the jigsaw of what I still believed to be the material world, fell into place.</p>
