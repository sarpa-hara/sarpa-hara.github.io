<p>Gabapentinoids are the Vegemite™ of pharmaceuticals: it&rsquo;s all love or hate, and almost never in between. If you clicked on this post, you are probably familiar with the fuzzy, electrifying stimulation brought about by an unholy dose of Pregabalin, or the fickle GHB-like lust from scarfing down Phenibut by the tablespoon, or the hassle of leaving CVS with bucket-sized refills of Gabapentin – the original gangsta Gabapentinoid.</p>
<p>I had assumed that my own first-hand familiarity with the &lsquo;Noids made me well-equipped for my future acquaintance with Tarlige™ (Mirogabalin Besylate). Who doesn&rsquo;t love to fall into a trap of extrapolating the love for one drug to the unfamiliar territory of another? I wish I could tell <em>you</em> that you will be transported from your own familiarity with these substances to a higher plane of Gabapentinoid experience, once you get a chance to mess around with Mirogabalin. I would be excited to advertise Mirogabalin as the true Lyrica 2: Electric Boogaloo, but then I would be a dishonest thrower of obscure substances into my body.</p>
<p><strong>DOSAGE</strong>: 10-35 mg.</p>
<p><strong>DURATION</strong>: 2-4 h.</p>
<p><strong>QUALITATIVE COMMENTS</strong>: (with 10 mg) This is something of an introverted Gabapentinoid, at least at therapeutic doses. No noticeable anxiolysis, euphoria or sedation. There&rsquo;s a faint numbness or tingling in my corregator muscles (right above each eyebrow), but I won&rsquo;t rush to attribute that to the drug. No resemblance to the more ubiquitous &lsquo;Noids.</p>
<p>(with 25 mg) The facial numbness is confirmed to be an emerging symptom. Pair that with a mild, but fairly long-lasting temple pounding and head squeeze. Reminds me of taking a nicotine-rich drag after a long break from smoking. No euphoria within a 50 mile radius. I feel <strong>affected</strong>, but not in a way I can even functionally describe, as disappointing as that sounds.</p>
<p>(with 35 mg) The facial numbness and head tightness emerge only once, on the come up, and the prominence is dose-dependent. At this fencepost, it is fair to say that therapeutic doses are not recreational. My thoughts seem very collected, and the &ldquo;cognitive swarm&rdquo; that flairs up daily, has been tranquilized. This might be a very introverted Gabapentinoid – that isn&rsquo;t to say that it&rsquo;s doing <em>nothing</em>. I feel a very Lyrica-esque dizziness coming in waves, as if this substance is desperately trying to mime a familiar state for its host, but the effect is not consistent enough.</p>
<p><strong>EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY:</strong> Pregabalin has a debaucherous, boisterous character: you can&rsquo;t miss its drunken persona. Gabapentin is sweet and shy, but definitely pleasant company. Mirogabalin is the guy sitting in the corner of the room, glued to his phone. He got invited to the party because of his exotic origins. Once you strike up a conversation, however, he makes you feel very comfortable in his presence.</p>
<p>I am someone who often has episodes of depersonalization/derealization – a disorder characterized by hardly articulable symptoms of momentary cognitive misalignment with the physical self. If that is something totally foreign to you, I can only recommend reading about the subject from more eloquent sources. If you&rsquo;re not a stranger to DP/DR, or if you are afflicted, Mirogabalin may pique your interest (this is not medical advice; I am not a doctor). On each of the 5 days I&rsquo;ve taken a dose, I have not had <strong>any</strong> symptoms from the DP/DR domain. Aside from Lamotrigine, Mirogabalin is the only substance that kept me utterly grounded and kept my thoughts from swarming like angry bees. I stopped taking Lamotrigine because it affected my short-term memory. I may, however, keep taking Mirogabalin as a kind of strangely unobtrusive, but <strong>profoundly effective grounding agent</strong>. Roll the &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s got that going for it&rdquo; meme; yet I believe that this isn&rsquo;t something to be overlooked.</p>
<p>I think by now you&rsquo;ve caught on to the emerging conclusion: no, it doesn&rsquo;t really make you high. Cue the sad trombone. I will be posting a follow-up report on the 40-60 mg range, but I am not comfortable with going above that, for the time being.</p>
