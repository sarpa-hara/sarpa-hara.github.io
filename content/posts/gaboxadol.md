_Disclaimer:  I can't and don't recommend Gaboxadol to anyone because it is a narrowly studied substance, and everything I say is just my opinion and not medical advice._

Tonight we're packing 20mg of Gaboxadol HCl in a gelatin cap in hopes of getting some stellar sleep, or I don't know, a couple' [rotating cubes](https://youtu.be/HM8WDZIhs3M?t=9803) or whatever.

I'm cheating a little because this is technically my 2nd trial. The 1st "allergy" trial was done with 10mg down the hatch, about a week ago. I am quite excited about this, because my first time was already something to write home about: about 20 minutes in, I got punched in the face with *really pronounced* sedation and a mildly dissociated headspace (minus the euphoria, which I felt on Zolpidem). By "dissociated" I mean, feeling like your limb movements are occurring ahead of the cognitive command that produced them, if that makes sense. As if you're a nonchalant puppet, observing your body being yanked around by an external force. That experience culminated in me promptly but comfortably passing out and dreaming about something deeply personal and somewhat introspective. Something I don't typically dream about (I also rarely remember my dreams in great detail, leading me to believe that Gaboxadol has some dream potentiating properties, *possibly*). I felt *very* well rested the next morning. It was quite night and day (ha-ha) compared to your average Zolpidem night.

Without further ado,

T+0:00 / Ingested 20mg Gaboxadol HCl w/ water. Only residual substances in my system are Baclofen (or what's left of 50mg from this morning) and caffeine.

Btw, the stuff tastes like battery acid on your tongue. Like a *mean* Warhead (for my fellow Americans).

T+0:15 / The gelatin cap was quite large, it might take a while to dissolve. Feeling generally a little nervous, for whatever reason.

T+0:26 / I think that dissociated headspace might be coming back, although who knows, placebo is a hell of a drug. Standing up and walking feels like gravity is pulling in 3 directions instead of 1. Kind of like a push-pull body sensation. Not a particularly anxiety-free headspace, to be honest. A little on edge.

T+0:55 / Again, not sure if this is coming straight out of my head, but the bodily sensations are a little wacky. My chest feels quite tight, which isn't making the steadily amplifying yawning any easier. Speaking of amplification, I can clearly hear every ambient squeak and creak of my living space. My entire body is subtly vibrating with these multi-directional gravity micro-pulls. Almost rocking back-and-forth in my bed. Do I feel sedated? Not quite, but this time, not quite dissociated either. It's not exactly a disconnect between the physical and the mental. Every movement feels like forced propulsion through thick jello. There's definitely an "effort" attached to movement at this point.

T+1:25 / We're traveling lightyears past the event horizon now. It only took me to *try* to get up to realize just how far into the woods this substance taken me. For the record, every sentence is taking about 40 seconds to type. This is no motherfucking Ambien. 

Imagine knowing what it's like to pop a metalonin pill, and then discovering Ambien for the first time. That's the rough approximation of GBX with Ambien being a reference point. I know, it doesn't sound particularly cinematic, but it's becoming quite tedious to mash the keys in all the right combinations, let alone articulate my thoughts properly. If a word is longer than 4 letters, I'm having to re-type it 2-3 times.

I am fucking pinned to the bed. There isn't a force that could make me get up in a hurry. Wow, typing is snail-like. I feel as if I'm being heaved upwards aggressively, and not just upwards, but in multiple directions, and every part of me might as well be encased in trembling lead. Here comes nausea. I think the strangest spect at thing junction, is that I don't feel *sedated*. I am, in fact, far, far from my usual familiar "lethargic" state. And let, I don't to move. I don't want to think. All my hands want, is to be put down. 

What's happening right now is quite spectacular and there's a metric tonne of "WTF" erupting in my head, but I am inn no eway going to be able to artgcular

-

Fuck it, trakc of time is lost. I wish Ha,milton had warned us abou the intisnsitivity

-

T+6:00(approx) / Woke up some 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep later (my cat interrupts my sleep on any typical night). First utterance coming out of my mouth being, naturally, “WHAT THE FUCK”.

I’m still a little fucked up, although I shouldn’t let this be taken the wrong way before I inevitably pass out again. I wouldn’t crudely call it a “hangover”. There isn’t (and wasn’t) any mental impairment going on. The strange gravity pulls are out the door, my visual field is no longer flickering, but the weird bodily vibration is still there. An after-vibe, of sorts. I’ll be writing up my conclusions shortly. Spoiler time: 

*Gaboxadol is beyond powerful.*

T+9:30(approx) / Okay. This has been a turbulent and (I want to stress) *minimally* recreational, although sufficiently therapeutic pharmacological quest. There will be a few additional edits incoming, as I'm trying to piece together my experience precisely and coherently.

I apologize in advance for being overly verbose. It's hard to cram hardly-articulable material into words.

If you're familiar with the saying "There is no free lunch", I would say that my impression of GBX echoes that saying quite clearly. The kind of "marketing talk" attributed to GBX often includes the assertion that "Gaboxadol is not reinforcing". I now know why that is being mentioned in the scientific literature.

I don't have any credentials to dish out pharmaceutical labels and coin new terms; but if I were sincerely marketing this substance, I would call Gaboxadol a *non-sedative superhypnotic*. For me, therein lies one of this drug's shortcomings. Crudely, it felt like taking a pharmacological sledgehammer to the face, in order to induce sleep. The dosage I chose (20mg initial + additional 5mg, 1 hour later) was not conventionally sedating in the slightest. Instead of "feeling sleepy" and mentally winding down, it felt more like a side effect-packed gun pointed at my head, as the drug commanded me to go to sleep, "or else". Although it goes without saying, that your mileage may vary, and it may vary wildly based on the dosage bracket.

The intense character of the strictly physical effects cannot be overstated. I think forcefully resisting sleep in order to recount the experience in real time, was a strategic mistake, and a show of disrespect towards the substance, which I felt punished for, in a way. Among the notable physical side effects, we have:

- Nauseating disorientation, causing some difficulty in walking, comparable to moderate doses of DXM.
- Strong "pulling" sensations in random directions when in motion, and a downward pull when stationary/lying down.
- A carousel-like spinning sensation, especially with closed eyes.
- A high-frequency vibration across the entire body.
- Rapidly flickering field of vision, like an annoying kid playing with a light switch in your brain, or like a shitty "haunted house" experience.
- Saturated visual snow.

The psychological effects, which are probably of deeper interest to people reading this, are (on some level) even more difficult to articulate than those of a moderately introspective and mind-warping psilocybin experience. Things take quite a weird turn here. Gaboxadol is not a visual hallucinogen, dissociative or deliriant -- yet, it is a powerful psychedelic substance belonging in an entirely separate category, which I would call a "temporal hallucinogen". Deep into the experience, I noted a very bizarre sensation of time distortion, which no verbal description will do enough justice to. Roughly every 5-10 seconds, my subjective perspective of time would get "stuck" in a scratched CD/broken record kind of way, where I felt frozen in a particular moment, then unstuck, then *rewound back to that moment*, then thrown back into a directed sense of passing time. My mind was continuously replaying clips of the immediate past in short-lasting looks. For example, looking at a particular object in space, I would almost simultaneously see what it looked like based on the way my eyes were fixated on it 5 seconds ago, and what it looked like in the present moment. At the time, my brain summarized this as a somewhat uncomfortable and messy perception of time. Combine that with the aforementioned body load, and you'll be hard-pressed to find any part of the overall experience "recreational". On the contrary, such an intense combination results in more of a "coercion" to go to sleep immediately, as the drug (fortunately) offers you the ability to fall asleep as a kind of "trip killer". Does this categorize an effective hypnotic? Not at the given dosage, perhaps. But you can be the judge. 

As every potent drug deserves a level of respect paid to it, the disrespectful move on my part was to actively try not to fall asleep. I vow to show more reverence in my next trial, which will not warrant a trip report, because I plan on sleeping through the experience contentedly and restfully -- as one should.

FAQ's

- Is this Ambien?
- Nope.
---
- But is this supersized Ambien on steroids?
- No, and I suggest you don't take this substance with that expectation. Ambien makes you pass out and forget. Gaboxadol will *make sure you remember how you were dumb enough to fight it and stay awake*.
---
- What's the optimal dose for the intended purpose?
- No more than 10mg. If you're on the lighter side, I would even suggest 5mg max.
---
- Is this the ultimate high?
- Nope.
---
- But will I get high?
- If that's your goal -- don't.
---
- Any introspection/mindfulness? Any chemically induced mysticism?
- There were moments. I'm happy to share in my DM's, or in the comments, if you're curious.
